## Lorenz Attractor
The [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is a strange attractor living in 3D space that relates three parameters arising in fluid dynamics. It is one of the Chaos theory's most iconic images and illustrates the phenomenon now known as the [Butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect) or (more technically) sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
