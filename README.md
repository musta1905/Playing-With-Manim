# Welcome!!!

Hello! These are some fun animation/simulation made using Manim created by Grant Sanderson popularly known as [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw).
This is a project about me using manim to make random stuff. 


## Installing Manim :
Manim runs on Python 3.7 or higher.

System requirements are：

- [FFmpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows)

- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org//) (included in python package PyOpenGL)

- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) (optional, if you want to use LaTeX)

- [Pango](https://pango.org/) (only for Linux)

### Installing On Windows : 
1. [Install FFmpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows) , and make sure that its path is in the PATH environment variable.
2. For creating virtual python environment using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) ( its really good!!! ) and install manim follow the steps [here](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation/uv.html) .
3. Change <code>uv add manim</code> to <code>uv add manimgl</code> if you are using manimgl.

### Installing on Linux or MacOS :
I don't really know **¯\_(ツ)_/¯** , it never worked for me see the installation documentation for [manimCE](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html) or [manimgl](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/getting_started/installation.html#).

## Running Manim

To run manim enter the command in the following format into terminal:
### ManimGL
