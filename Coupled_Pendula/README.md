## Coupled Pendula
The coupled pendulum is a system of two pendulum connected with either string or a spring. With each swing energy is transferred from one pendulum to the other. If the pendulums both have the same length one pendulum comes to a complete stop before alternating motion ! [Here](https://youtu.be/izy4a5erom8) is a great vide explaining the physics behind it !!!
